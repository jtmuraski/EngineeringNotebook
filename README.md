# EngineeringNotebook
 This repo is my digital notebook of all the day to day lessons that I learn on the job, in trainings and after experimenting. This also holds all the notes that I will be taking on different languages that I learn and technologies that I work with. All files are markdown files made with the Obsidian notetaking app
