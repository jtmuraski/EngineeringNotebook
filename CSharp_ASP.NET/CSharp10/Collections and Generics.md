#### Collections

1. There are 3 divisions of collections:
	1. Linear => Array, lists, stacks etc
	 2. Associative => Dictionary, HashTable
        3. Graphs => Proper graphs, trees,  etc
2. Collections are organically generics, but generics are applicable to other designs too
3. SInce C# is a statically typed language, it needs to confirm the datatypes in order to compile. In order to use Generics, the compiler can use constraints that you put in to verify the types
4. Most Collections are natiely generic(```List<T>``` ) 
5. The type of a generic is only specified with when the generic type is used
