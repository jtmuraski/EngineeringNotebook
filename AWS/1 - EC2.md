1. Virtual machine server that exists in AWS

### Sizing and Configuration
- There are severtal options to configure when starting an EC2 instance, which include (there are more options as well)
	- OS
	- CPU
	- RAM
	- Storage
		- Network attached (EBS/EFS)
		- Hardware (EC2 Instance store)
	- Network cardf
	- Firewall rules
	- Bootstrap Script
- Boostraping
	- This is an automated script that is run when the instance boots up
	- This script is run only once
	- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as 
		- Installing updates
		- installing software
		- Download common files
		- Just about any other task
	- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

### Instance Types

###### Naming Convention
- Example: m2.2xLarge
	- *m*: Instance Class
	- *5*: Generation
	- *2xLarge*: Size within the instance class
- 
###### Types
- General Purpose (class t)
	- Balanced between compute, memory and networking
	- Good for general use web servers
- Compute Optimized (class *C*)
	- Compute intensive tasks such as batch processing workfloads, media transcoding, machine learning and dedicated gaming servers
- Memory Optimied (class *m*)
	- Workfloads that require large amounts of memory
		- high performace databases
		- web scale cache stores
		- In-memory databases optimized for BI uses
- Storage Optimized (class *i, d, h1* **)
	- Great for storage intensive tasks
		- NoSQL databases
		- Data warehouses
- Can get info on different instance types from https://www.ec2instances.info/
### Security
- Security Groups are the fundamental unit of network security in AWS
- Control how traffic is allowed in and out of EC2 instances
- Can only contain ALLOW rules. => They specify what someone or thing can do, and if it's not explicity allowed, it is denied
- These act as a firewall on EC2 instances
- They regulate
	- Ports
	- Authorized IP ranges
	- Conttrol of inbound and outbound traffic
- One group can be attached to multiple groups
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- Lives outside the EC2 instance, if traffic is blocked the instance won't see it
- It is a good practice to maintain a seperate security group for SSH access
- If your application is not accessible, it is likely a security group issue
- If you get a "connection refused" error on your application, then it's an application error or it's not launched
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is authorized by default
##### Refrencing Other Security Groups
- A security group can allow other instances with a different security group attached, it can allow instances through, or block other securtiy groups
	- 
###### Ports To Know
- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a linuz instance
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files to a file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP access unsecured website
- 443 = HTTPS - access secured access
- 3389 = RDP log into a windows instance

### Instance Storage
##### EBS
- EBS = Elastic Block Storage
- EBS are network drives that you can attach to an EC2 instance
- Can only be attached to one instance at a time and is boudn to an availability zone
- You can think of them like a network USB stick
- This is a network drive - not a physical harddrive
- Can easily be detached from one instance and attached to another
- Capacity must be provisioned in advance
- Delete on Termination Attribute
	- If this is checked when the EBS volumne is created, when the EC2 instance it is attached to is deleted, this volumn will also be deleted
##### EBS Volume Types
- gp2/ gp2 : General purpose SSD volume that balances performance for wide variety of tasks
- io 1/ io2: Highest performance SSD volume for mission critical low latency or high throughput workloads
- st1 : HDD lost cost volume designed for frequently accessed throughput intensive workloads
- sc1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD voumne designed for less frequently accessed workloads
Volumes are charactered in the following ways:
1) Size
2) Throughput
3) IOPS (I/O Ops Per Sec)
Only the SSD volumes can be used as boot volumes for an EC2 instance
##### Volumn Type Use Cases
- General Purpose SSD
	- Cost effective storage, low latency
	- System boot volumes Virtual desktops, Development and test environments
	- 1 GiB - 16TiB
	- gp2/gp3
- Provisoned IOPS SSD
	- Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
	- Applications that need more than 16,000 IOPS
	- Great for database workloads
	- io1 / io2
- Hard Disk Drives
	- Cannot be used as boot drives
	- 125GB to 16TB
	- Throughput Optimized HDD
		- Big Data, Data Warehouses
		- Log processing
		- Max throughput 500 Mb/s
	- Cold HDD
		- For data that is infrequently accessed
		- Where low cost is most important
		- Max throughput of 250 MB/sec

##### EBS Multi Attach
- Only available for the io1 / io2 family of volumes
- Allows the same EBS volume to be attahced to multiple insances
- Each instance has full read write permissions to the volume
- Use Case:
	- Achieve higher application availability in clustered Linu applications
	- Applications must manage concurrent write operations
- Up to 16 EC2 Instances at a time
- Must use a file sustem that is cluster aware (Not XFS, EX4, etc)
#### EFS (Elastic File System)
- Managed Network FIle SYstem
- can be mounted on many EC2 instances
- Works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Highly available, sclable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use
- Used for content management, web serving, data sharing, Wordpress
- Uses POSIX file sysyem (Linux)
- EFS SCale
	- 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10 GB+/s throughput
	- Grow to Petabyte scal network file system
- Performance Mode (set at EFS creation time)
	- General Purpose (Default) - latency sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc)
	- Max I/O - higher latency, throughput
- Throughput Mode
	- Bursting - 1 TB = 50 MB/s + burst up to 100 MB/sec
	- Provisioned - set your throughput regardless of storage size, ex
	- Elasitc - automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workloads
		- Up to 3 GB/s for reads and 1 Gb/s for writes
		- Used for unpredicatble workloads
- Storage Classes
	- Storage Tiers:
		- Standard: Frequnt accessed files
		- Infrequent Access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store. ENabled with a lifecycle policy
