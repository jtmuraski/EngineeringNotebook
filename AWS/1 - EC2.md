1. Virtual machine server that exists in AWS

### Sizing and Configuration
- There are severtal options to configure when starting an EC2 instance, which include (there are more options as well)
	- OS
	- CPU
	- RAM
	- Storage
		- Network attached (EBS/EFS)
		- Hardware (EC2 Instance store)
	- Network cardf
	- Firewall rules
	- Bootstrap Script
- Boostraping
	- This is an automated script that is run when the instance boots up
	- This script is run only once
	- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as 
		- Installing updates
		- installing software
		- Download common files
		- Just about any other task
	- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

### Instance Types

###### Naming Convention
- Example: m2.2xLarge
	- *m*: Instance Class
	- *5*: Generation
	- *2xLarge*: Size within the instance class
- 
###### Types
- General Purpose (class t)
	- Balanced between compute, memory and networking
	- Good for general use web servers
- Compute Optimized (class *C*)
	- Compute intensive tasks such as batch processing workfloads, media transcoding, machine learning and dedicated gaming servers
- Memory Optimied (class *m*)
	- Workfloads that require large amounts of memory
		- high performace databases
		- web scale cache stores
		- In-memory databases optimized for BI uses
- Storage Optimized (class *i, d, h1* **)
	- Great for storage intensive tasks
		- NoSQL databases
		- Data warehouses
- Can get info on different instance types from https://www.ec2instances.info/
### Security
- Security Groups are the fundamental unit of network security in AWS
- Control how traffic is allowed in and out of EC2 instances
- Can only contain ALLOW rules. => They specify what someone or thing can do, and if it's not explicity allowed, it is denied
- These act as a firewall on EC2 instances
- They regulate
	- Ports
	- Authorized IP ranges
	- Conttrol of inbound and outbound traffic
- One group can be attached to multiple groups
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- Lives outside the EC2 instance, if traffic is blocked the instance won't see it
- It is a good practice to maintain a seperate security group for SSH access
- If your application is not accessible, it is likely a security group issue
- If you get a "connection refused" error on your application, then it's an application error or it's not launched
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is authorized by default
##### Refrencing Other Security Groups
- A security group can allow other instances with a different security group attached, it can allow instances through, or block other securtiy groups

###### Ports To Know
- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a linuz instance
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files to a file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP access unsecured website
- 443 = HTTPS - access secured access
- 3389 = RDP log into a windows instance
