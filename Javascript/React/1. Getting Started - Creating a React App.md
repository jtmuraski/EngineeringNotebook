A new React app can be created in teh following way:
```
npm create-react-app *name-of-app*
```

This will then download and set up all of the files that are needed to initiate a React app in the current directory of the terminal. You will then need to change directory to the newly created . Then start the app to ensure that everything was installed correctly.
```
cd *name-of-app*
npm start
```

#### Create a Next.js React App
Next.js is a framework for working and creating a React app and is slightly different from the base way of working with React. You can create a Next React app in the terminal using the following commands. *Note: you will need to have node.js installed for this to work*
```
npm init -y
npm install react react-dom next
```

You will then need to ensure that the following exists in teh "scripts" section of the newly created package.json file:
```
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
```

Next.js supports file based routing instead of a single-page web application. So the pages are js files that will need to go into a pages folder. index.js would be the root file for the website. You will then need to create a pages folder and then an index.js file in your directory.
